# The things which are provided and worked on by Angular can also be done using the capapbilities of jquery/or even plain jvascript but
why we use Angular is because :
1. It provides a clean application code structure 
2. Includes a lot of reuable code
3. Makes the application more testable

# The application arhitecture of Angular application comprises of :

HTML + CSS + Javascript + Angular           ------->         Backend -end deveopnment
  (Front End)                                                  (APIs and databases)
  
 # Setting of an Angular developnment environment
 1. Installation of the node  - ( we can download node from the official node website ; once node is downloaded we can check 
 it's latest version by node --version)
 2. Once node is installed we will be using npm to install the third parties libraries . like Angular CLI (to create initial angular
 application stucuture or some boilerplate code)
 npm install -g @angular/cli ( g to install it across the system)
 
 For installation in the mac machine 
 sudo npm install -g @angular/cli
 
 (in order to check the correct installation of the Angular CLI we do : ng --version)
 
 # Once the dvelopnment environment is setup we can go ahead with the new Angular project creation with below command :
 ng new hello-world
 The above command will create the basic boilerplate code needed for the kickstart of the application and can be viewed in the 
 browser by writing :
 ng serve
 
 At times we might run into version mistmaches of different packages installed in the application in order to avoid/rectify the
 issues we might need to remove the ^ from the package.json file in the application and then run 
 npm update 
 The above would resolve the version mis-match issues with the application .
 
 # As a concept of different programming languages for the application kickstart there is main.ts file in the application 
 which forms the starting point of the application and this file in turns takes care of the application bootstrapping .
 
 If we make any changes in the angular application all the package and bundle dependencies are automatically compiled and are corresponding
 changes are reflected in the application .
 This is know as HMR (Hot Module Replacement) where the modules are replaced with the corresponding changes .

Typescript tranpiles to javascript for the browser to understand .

sudo npm install -g typescript
tsc --version (tells about typescript version)
