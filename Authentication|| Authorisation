In order to create the arhitecture for the authentication/authorisation we need a client server side interface .
On the client side we need a login page on the server side we need an API end-point in order to authenticate the
logged in user .

If the signed in user credential are authenticated by the backend we are going to return the JWT (json web token )from the bakend 
JWT token contains few valid info for the logged in user (like ther role , email)

In order to maintain the JWT received by the server all client side applications should store them somewhere in the application
Ideally it is done on the local storage so even if the user closes the browser the token should persisit in there

By making use of the JWT on the client side we can perform the following roles :
- Display current user's name
- Show/hide parts of the page
- Prevent access to certian routes in the application

Parts of the JWT token -  A JWT token consist of the following parts 
- HEADER (alg,type="jwt" )
- PAYLOAD (sub, name,admin)
- VERIFY SIGNATURE (to provide security to the JWT token)
